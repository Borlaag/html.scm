# html.scm

**tl;dr:** input Scheme, output HTML

Scheme DSL that compiles to HTML. The goal is to implement all elements and attributes as Scheme wrappers. 
The [MDN HTML elements reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) is a good resource
that lists all of them with some additional documentation.

## Example

Below is a high level idea of what the input and generated output would look like using a contrived and simple example.

```scheme
;; Writing HTML in Scheme
(html (body
      (h1 "My First Heading")
      (p "My first paragraph.")))
```

```html
<!-- HTML generated by html.scm -->
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Why?

It's a building block or stepping stone for a slightly bigger idea I have to write a static website generator
in Scheme where all sources, including HTML templates and CSS styling, are written in Scheme.
